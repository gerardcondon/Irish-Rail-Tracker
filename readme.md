## Irish Rail Tracker

I'm working on this site to learn web development. Specifically I want to learn 
* how to use HTML and CSS correctly
* Backbone
* Google Maps API. 
The site uses the Irish Rail realtime [api](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/). It plots the locations of Irish Rail's train stations on a map. It will eventually show the status of the trains and times also.

A live version of the site is available [here](http://www.gerardcondon.com/projects/irishrail/index.html).
