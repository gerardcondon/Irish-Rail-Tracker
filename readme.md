## Irish Rail Tracker

I'm working on this site to learn how to use Backbone and also the Google Maps API. It uses the Irish Rail realtime [api](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/). It plots the locations of Irish Rail's train stations on a map. It will eventually show the status of the trains and times also.
